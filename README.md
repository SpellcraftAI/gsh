### A natural language shell for Bash and Powershell.

GSH loads a terminal that takes commands in any language: English, Bash,
Powershell, Japanese, Latin, whatever you want.

It converses with you by printing to stdout and taking the actions you ask for
by calling commands.

potentially destroying data.
