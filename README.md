# GSH: Natural Language Terminal

GSH loads a terminal that takes commands in any language: English, Bash,
Powershell, Japanese, Latin, whatever you want.

It converses with you by printing to stdout and taking the actions you ask for
by calling commands.

As a security and safety precaution, GSH is designed to prompt before
potentially destroying data.
